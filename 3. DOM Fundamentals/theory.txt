/*
DOM -> Document Object Model -> Structured representation of HTML documents.
Allows javascript to access elements and styles to manipulate them.
The elements are organised into a tree structure which is generated by the browser on HTML Load.
DOM Methods and Properties for DOM Manipulation are not part of JS.
They are part of Web APIs which are javascript libraries.


BASIC DOM MANIPULATION

// SELECT ELEMENT
const message = document.querySelector('.message') -> Select element by class

console.log(message.textContent) -> Log the text inside the element

message.textContent = 'ðŸŽ‰ Correct Number!' -> Change element text

console.log(document.querySelector('.guess').value) -> Get value of an input

EVENT LISTENER
selectedElement.addEventListener('click', functionName) -> Whenever a click occurs on the selectedElement, the function is executed
* Function can be written inside the declaration
* Event type is not restricted to 'click', check MDN for all events
Example:
checkButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
	console.log(guess.value);
});
